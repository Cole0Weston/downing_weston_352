% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\setlist[itemize]{leftmargin=3 cm}
\setlist[enumerate]{leftmargin=3cm}



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript

}
%Generally you should be the only author, so drop Michael Shell's name when you are creating your lab reports

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\section{Introduction}




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
The popular table-top game, Dungeons \& Dragons®, is very complex and requires a lot of time to play. The game's inventory and skill systems are some of the most complex systems in the game, and they requires a great amount of paper resources to keep up with. Our proposed program will be able to efficiently manage an inventory system and will facilitate the management of each player's own character. Users of our program will benefit from its ability to automatically keep up with players' inventories and character sheets without forcing them to look through the player guide or exhaust their paper supplies.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because

\subsection{Background}

A table-top adventure game, such as Dungeons \& Dragons®, is played using a large quantity of paper. Every player has a \textit{character sheet} containing information about a player's character, an \textit{inventory sheet} containing information about a character's inventory and equipment, and a \textit{spell sheet} containing the list of spells and abilities each character has access to. A player must also use paper to make story notes and record enemy positions during \textit{encounters} (fights). There are many different classes and races that players must choose from when making their character. Because of this, the skills and inventories of every player is uniquely constructed. 
The decision to create a new character management application was born from our shared annoyance with the time-consuming tediousness of sorting and sifting through stacks of paper every time we play Dungeons \& Dragons®. We found ourselves spending more time managing our characters than we did playing the game. Our program aims to make Dungeons \& Dragons® less paper dependent.

\subsection{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item D\&D® 5e, while less complex than previous versions (see: D\&D® 3.5e), still has a massive degree of complexity in terms of interworking parts. Stats are affected by items, items affect stats, and there is simply a massive variety of permutations.
\item Choosing a design pattern to work with is going to be crucial. It needs to be able to create a variety of items and item types.
\item It must be able to implement search and sorting functions to find certain items quickly and with as few clicks as possible.
\item Designing a save system for the game will require learning how to make a save system or, at the very least, require the program to read and write user information to/from a file using a consistent format. Either way, it will be challenging.
\item Making an user friendly UI will be difficult due to our team's lack of experience with making UI's. Further research into graphic design might be for the best.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
The goal of the D\&D® 5e Campaign Assistant is to provide a user-friendly interface through which players of D\&D® 5e can manage and keep track of their player characters. By project completion the user(s) should be able to, at the very minimum, seamlessly manage a character sheet which includes a spell list, inventory, and attributes.
\subsection{Requirements}
The functional and non-functional requirements for this program are listed below. Alongside those, we have included a list of stretch goals that will potentially become basic (immediate) goals depending on how the semester progresses.

%As part of fleshing out the scope of your requirements, you'll also need to keep in mind both your functional and non-functional requirements.  These should be listed, and explained in detail as necessary.  Use this area to explain how you gathered these requirements.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item User must be able to input and keep track of all relevant information present on standard D\&D® 5e character sheets \ref{CharacterSheet}.
\item Program must properly manage player characters' inventories e.g. item weight, weapon statistics, and item value.
\item Program must be able to write character sheet info to disk and subsequently load from such files.
\item User must be able to create items following certain templates -- customizable gear is a staple of D\&D®.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item Program should reliably load all open files from previous save state.
\item Program should be able to concurrently manage at least 10 character sheets (for assistance in managing an entire party of player characters).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Separate permissions added for \textit{dungeon master}. -- It would be cool to see special DM only privileges for non-player character (NPC) inventory management.
\item Inventory randomization for NPC stores, or generation of unique procedural items.
\item A "campaign manager," or a system by which an entire party's sheets can be managed by the DM for record-keeping purposes.
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
\caption{USE CASE TABLE}
\label{tab:useCaseIndex}
\end{table}


\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 1
\item[Use Case Name:] Create a new character
\item[Description:] User has opened the program and needs to create a new character sheet. They will click the ``Create New Character" option upon opening the program. This will create a blank character sheet.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item User opens a new instance of the program.
\item User left-clicks on ``Create New Character" option from the startup window.
\item A new tab is created containing a blank character sheet, and the main window is opened.
\item[Termination Outcome:] The user now has a blank character sheet instance opened in a new tab.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 2
\item[Use Case Name:] Edit existing character
\item[Description:] User has opened the program and needs to edit an existing character sheet. They will click the ``Load Existing Character" option upon opening the program. This should open an existing character sheet from disk in a new tab. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item User opens a new instance of the program.
\item User left-clicks on ``Load Existing Character" option from the startup window.
\item A new tab is created containing the character sheet, and the main window is opened.
\item[Termination Outcome:] The user has now opened an existing character sheet instance in a new tab and is ready to begin editing.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 3
\item[Use Case Name:] Save the current character
\item[Description:] User has a character sheet open in a tab. They will click the save icon in the main window. This will save the current character sheet to disk, prompting if the file has not yet been saved.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item User has a previously saved character sheet open.
\item User left-clicks on the save icon in the main window.
\item[Termination Outcome:] The file on disk has been overwritten with new character sheet data.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Alternative:] Current character sheet has not been saved.
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item User has an unsaved character sheet open.
\item User left-clicks on the save icon in the main window.
\item User is prompted to choose a save directory and file name.
\item[Termination Outcome:] The file has been saved to disk.
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Timeline}

\end{table}


\section{Project Structure}
The structure of the project centers around a list of Character objects (one of which is active at any given time), to be passed between the various Windows of the program. Each individual Character object contains all information which would be maintained within a standard D\&D 5e character sheet - most importantly a list of ability scores, skill values, inventory items, and spells. Logic for the calculation of many of these items is contained within the Character class, and the main purpose of each Window is to display these attributes in an easily digestable form.\\
For example, ability bonuses and skill values will not be directly accessible by the end user, but rather are internally maintained and calculated by the logic within the Character class (using the pertinent logic from the Player's Handbook which would generally be calculated by hand.)\\
Several fields (e.g. Feats, Abilities, etc.) will simply be text fields with arbitrary contents, to be freely edited by the end user. This is to allow for the greatest degree of flexibility in using the character manager - facets of D\&D such as these are often not cut-and-dry enough to easily facilitate a better method of organization.\\

\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
Observer - Both the ProficiencyObserver and AbilityObserver classes are implementations of the Observer pattern, and are used to keep ability bonuses, skill values, and so forth in sync.

\section{Results}
This section will start out a little vague, but it should grow as your project evolves.  With each deliverable you hand in, give me a final summary of where your project stands.  By the end, this should be a reflective section discussing how many of your original goals you managed to attain/how many desired use cases you implemented/how many extra features you added.

\subsection{Future Work}
Where are you going next with your project?
For early deliverables, what are your next steps?  (HINT: you will typically want to look back at your timeline and evaluate: did you meet your expected goals?  Are you ahead of schedule?  Did you decide to shift gears and implement a new feature?)
By the end, what do you plan on doing with this project?  Will you try to sell it?  Set it on fire?  Link to it on your resume and forget it exists?
